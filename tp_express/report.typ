= What is ExpressJS?

Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. APIs.

ExpressJS allows us to create a simple webserver, add middlewares depending on our needs, as well as get and respond to requests to make a REST API.

= Middlewares

Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle. The next middleware function is commonly denoted by a variable named next.

Middleware functions can perform the following tasks:

   - Execute any code.
   - Make changes to the request and the response objects.
   - End the request-response cycle.
   - Call the next middleware function in the stack.

In this TP, we're going to make a simple CRUD application that can add, retrieve, update and delete items.
